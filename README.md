# Capstone Project

Hand Gesture Recognition


DEPLOYMENT :

IMPORT OUR GITHUB REPOSITORY AS zip file 
Open hand gesture detection.py 
Then run the file
 You’re ready to go 

Software quality and testing :
We have trained and tested the data with multiple people in different lighting environment 
Building a basic hand gesture recognition platform was our plan which we achieved.

Security:
As our project executes on the local host and it is real time, so doesn’t use any of the personal data.
The libraries we have used are Python OPEN CV, Tensorflow, Numpy are very secure.


Technologies Used

 DeepLabCut: 
DeepLabCut is a popular open-source toolbox for markerless pose estimation based on deep learning. It allows researchers and developers to track the movement of body parts in videos with high accuracy and precision. DeepLabCut uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the poses of body parts from annotated training data. Once trained, the model can predict the poses of body parts in new video frames, enabling researchers to analyze animal behavior, human movement, and other related tasks.

The process of using DeepLabCut involves several steps:

Data Collection: Record videos of the subject performing the desired behavior.
Data Annotation: Manually label the positions of body parts in the video frames.
Model Training: Train the DeepLabCut model using the annotated data to learn the poses of body parts.
Pose Estimation: Use the trained model to predict the poses of body parts in new video frames.
DeepLabCut is widely used in various fields, including neuroscience, biomechanics, and behavioral science, for analyzing movement and behavior.

TensorFlow: Role in Building and Training Deep Learning Models:
TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for building and training deep learning models. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that make it easy to develop and deploy machine learning models at scale.

TensorFlow's key features include:

Flexible Architecture: TensorFlow allows developers to build and train a wide range of machine learning models, from simple linear regressions to complex deep neural networks.
Scalability: TensorFlow is designed to scale seamlessly from running on a single CPU to distributed computing clusters, enabling training on large datasets.
High Performance: TensorFlow leverages hardware acceleration, such as GPUs and TPUs, to achieve high performance in training and inference.
Rich Ecosystem: TensorFlow has a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools, such as TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for production pipelines and TensorFlow Hub for reusable machine learning components.
TensorFlow is widely used in various industries for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.

Python OpenCV: Importance in Image Processing and Computer Vision Tasks:
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source library for computer vision and image processing tasks. It provides a wide range of functionalities for processing, analyzing, and manipulating images and videos.
Some key features of OpenCV include:

Image Processing: OpenCV provides functions for basic image processing tasks, such as filtering, edge detection, and image transformation.
Object Detection: OpenCV includes algorithms for object detection and recognition, such as Haar cascades and deep learning-based methods.
Feature Detection: OpenCV provides algorithms for feature detection and matching, such as SIFT, SURF, and ORB.
Camera Calibration: OpenCV includes functions for camera calibration, which is essential for tasks like 3D reconstruction and augmented reality.
OpenCV is widely used in various fields, including robotics, augmented reality, and medical image analysis, for its ease of use and extensive functionality.
